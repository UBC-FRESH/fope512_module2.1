    "Welcome to FRST-318 Lab 1! If you made it this far, then you must have clicked on a link posted to Canvas, which opened up in the system default browser on your workstation, where you were asked to log in using your UBC CWL credentials, then some automated stuff happened really quickly, and somehow you ended up here. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are looking at a _Jupyter Notebook_ (running in the _JupyterLab_ interface), hosted on the UBC _Syzygy_ server. We will be using this environment for several labs throughout the term, so we will now unpack that the previous sentence into its constituent bits.\n",

    ">The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Jupyter Notebook medium to present text, links, equations, and live code. We will use the notebooks to import and manipulate data, create interactive visualizations, etc. The goal here is to re-inforce and bring to life some of the technical concepts presented during the lectures, in an interactive and (hopefully) fun way.\n",

JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters. Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterLab is the interface that you use to view, edit, and run the notebooks. It is relatively simple to use, and we will provide all the training you need to get up and running.\n",

This site is a brief introduction on how to use these computing tools. Syzygy is pronounced like the start of “Sizzle” – sizz eh gee. It means the alignment of three or more celestial objects. In this book, it represents the alignment of text, math, and code in a convenient tool called a Jupyter notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "This lab will loop back to some of the quantitative microeconomic topics that we covered in class during weeks 1-3. For each topic, we provide a quick recap the theory, followed by an interactive simulation. Our objective is to _bring to life_ and _demystify_ some of the key quantitative microeconmic topics (that we suspect, from past experience and student feedback) that some of you may still be struggling with. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, this lab will cover:\n",
    "* production functions and isoquants\n",
    "* isorevenu and isocost\n",
    "* optimal production points\n",
    "* diminishing marginal return\n",
    "* shadow pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this lab, simply read through this notebook from top to bottom, and follow the instructions. At several points, you will be asked to perform specify tasks (e.g., find the minimum cost solution to a production problem), and to record specify information or to save specify output files (which you will later submit via the Canvas interface to get credit for this lab). \n",
    "\n",
    "An instructor and a TA will be present throughout the lab session, to answer questions, help with technical issues, and generally help you connect all the dots.   \n",
    "\n",
    "__Canvas lab submissions will be due before midnight on Friday each week.__ Late submissions will not be graded. If you cannot finish all of the tasks before the end of the lab period, you can finish the lab later (you can log into the the Syzygy interface from any computer with a browser and an internet access).

    "A _production function_ describes the _output_ of a production process to its _inputs_, from the perspective of the producer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will model a production function for a firm that produces a single output $q \\in \\mathbb{R}+$. We could generalize this to include firms that produce multiple products, but that induces some extra challenges with displaying output, so for this labw we will limit the analysis to single-product firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the general case, a firm can have a set $\\{z_1, z_2, \\dots, z_N\\}$ inputs. For this lab, we will limit our analysis to 2 inputs (e.g., labour and capital, like in the examples shown during some of the lectures).\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(z_1, z_2) = {z_1}^u {z_2}^v\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This specific form of the production function is known as the _Cobb-Douglas_ production function, after Charles W. Cobb and Paul H. Douglas, who first published this production in [The American Economic Review][1] in 1928.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $q$-isoquants of $f$ are given by\n",

    "$$\n",

    "The parameters $u$ and $v$ relate productivity to the magnitude of each input.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If $u + v > 1$, the system has _increasing returns to scale_. \n",
    "When $u + v < 1$, the system has _diminishing returns to scale_. \n",
    "When $u + v = 1$, the system has _constant returns to scale_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, lets putting all this theory into practice using some Python code, which will generate some interactive plots of the system. These will include some variables that we can manipulate, which will help you better understand how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together. \n",
